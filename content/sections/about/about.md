I'm a full-stack engineer with a passion for creating responsive websites and web applications.

Prior to coding, I spent 3 years working as a program analyst for a $10 billion government procurement contract. While there, I built vendor relations, negotiated prices, tracked requisitions, and managed the procurement. I also have experience in the hospitality industry, specifically restaurant management, as well as being an Army veteran.
